To complete the requirement for the Master of Software Engineering program at Birzeit University, these classifications are part of the master’s thesis preparation, so please help with this work.

# Supervisor: Dr. Abualseoud Hanani
# Student name: Nasri Ladaa

# Usability
Degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. Example: ”I have to navigate into three pages before reach my appointment page”


# Reliability

# Portability
Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a system, product or component can be transferred from one hardware, software or other operational or usage environment to another. Example: “On my tablet it worked fine but on the phone nothing appeared”


# Performance
Performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions.

Example:“ I have to wait 10 seconds to see all my notifications”
Learnability
Degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals of learning to use the product or system with effectiveness, efficiency, freedom from risk and satisfaction in a specified context of use. Example:“I used many similar apps all of them have quick tutorial to get started”


# Compatibility
Degree to which a product, system or component can exchange information with other products, systems or components, and/or perform its required functions, while sharing the same hardware or software environment. Example:“My live match are not synced with FIFA official schedule”


# Security
